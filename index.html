   So what's actually going on?
  </h2>
  <p>
   This tool works on the concept that your latency to the server should be roughly equivalent to the servers latency to
   you. While there might be some slight variation, a connection from your computer to my server should take
   approximately as long to connect as a connection from my server to your computer (or router, as the case may be -
   wherever your public IP points to).
  </p>
  <div class="box has-text-centered">
   <img src="assets/images/straight-connect.png" alt="straight connection to server">
  </div>
  <p>
   If you're behind a VPN or a proxy, my server will see <i>their</i> public IP instead of yours. What this means is
   that the latency for you computer to my server <i>also</i> includes the latency from your computer through the proxy
   to its public IP.
  </p>
  <div class="box has-text-centered">
   <img src="assets/images/proxy-connect.png" alt="connection to server through proxy">
  </div>
  <p>
   So the system is pretty simple - from your browser, I ping the server a bunch of times and get an average latency.
   I then send that to the server, which pings your public IP a bunch of times, to get its <i>own</i> average latency.
   I compare the two, and based on how much variation there is, decide if you're likely to be hiding behind a VPN or
   proxy.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subtitle">
   How reliable is this?
  </h2>
  <p>
   I don't know. You tell me. It's just a theory, and as you can see running a bunch of pings takes some time. I'm also
   leveraging existing libraries for getting latency via javascript and PHP, because I wasn't interested in rolling my
   own. If you cared about performance, you could probably figure out a way to do it more efficiently.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subtitle">
   Wouldn't this be really easy to block?
  </h2>
  <p>
   In the current form, yes, however you could potentially use other connections that your app already has to make
   (i.e. loading data) to get an average connection speed/latency.
  </p>
  <p>
   This idea also relies on the fact that it can ping your public IP - a lot of servers are configured to explicitly
   not respond to a ping, so it may fall over there, too.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, a smart VPN or proxy might detect the calls and replace the average response time in the comparison call,
   but if your VPN or proxy is actively editing your requests... maybe it's not that good for security.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subtitle">
   What about false positives?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Also very possible just due to local network infrastructure. If your connection through your router adds 20-30ms to
   your latency, then that could show up as possible VPN usage. However, if your network infrastructure <i>does</i> do
   this, maybe it's time to buy a new router.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's also possible that random fluctuations in the networking gear on the server end could cause false positives, or
   even just a heavy load on the server could cause it to have random slow-downs that are interpreted as a latency issue
   despite actually just being a slow processing/response time.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subtitle">
   Can I see the code?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Sure. It's available on github at <a href="https://github.com/samlev/vpn-detect">samlev/vpn-detect</a>. For this
   version, the grunt work is being done by <a href="https://github.com/nesk/network.js">network.js</a> and on the
   server <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Ping">Ping for PHP</a>. Again, there's probably much more reliable and
   efficient ways of achieving this, but I just wanted to test if the concept would even work at all.
  </p>
  <p>
   I wouldn't suggest using this in production anywhere, but it's just an experiment to see if you <i>can</i> detect VPN
   or proxy usage with just PHP and javascript.
